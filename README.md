## General Information

This project was created as a bachelors project together with Fair Deal AS, SmartFurniture.  

The project is a proof-of-concept, and lacks some features for usability/UI, but can still be viewed with the above link. The site is meant to give a user information on how to assemble their furniture, as a useful tool alongside any normal instruction pamphlet.  

All the models are created from scratch as part of the project, and are made using Blender. They are imperfect with regards to the UV-mapping, but the animations were a more important part of the project. (Animations are also made for this project using Blender).
